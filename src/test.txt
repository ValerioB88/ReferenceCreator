Taylor and Lupker (2001) reported a pattern of results
in a naming task that they referred to as sequential effects.
Specifically, when randomly mixed sets of easy and
difficult stimuli were named, latencies were 8–17 msec
shorter following an easy-to-name stimulus than following
a difficult-to-name stimulus. Crucially, this pattern
was essentially independent of the nature of the stimuli
being named, since the pattern arose when high-frequency
consistent words were mixed with nonwords, when highand
low-frequency inconsistent words were mixed, and
when easy and hard nonwords were mixed.
The fact that sequential effects were a function only
of stimulus difficulty, and not of the qualitative nature
of the stimuli (e.g., words vs. nonwords), led Taylor and
Lupker (2001) to conclude that their effects were not due
to trial-to-trial shifts in the way the stimuli were named.
In particular, they concluded that their sequential effects
were not due to a shifting of route emphasis within a dualroute
framework (e.g., Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon,
& Ziegler, 2001). The idea that readers have the ability to
shift route emphasis has received considerable attention
recently (e.g., Monsell, Patterson, Graham, Hughes, &
Milroy, 1992; Zevin & Balota, 2000). The specific suggestion
is that readers can facilitate performance by strategically
altering route emphasis in anticipation of particular
stimulus types (e.g., nonwords). There would then be a
cost if the subsequent stimulus was a different type (e.g.,
a word). If readers were making changes of this sort in
Taylor and Lupker’s (2001) experiments, the expectation
is that sequential effects would have been dependent on
the nature of the stimuli named on adjacent trials, in contrast
to the independence that Taylor and Lupker (2001)
observed.
Taylor and Lupker (2001) interpreted their results as
being due to readers’ use of a time criterion (Chateau &
Lupker, 2003; Kinoshita & Lupker, 2002, 2003; Lupker,
Brown, & Colombo, 1997) when naming letter strings.
According to the time criterion account, readers establish
a point in time at which they expect to respond (their criterion
placement) and then try to respond when that time
criterion is reached. Taylor and Lupker (2001) suggested
two ways in which sequential effects could arise within
this framework. One way is that participants adjust the
position of their time criterion on a trial-by-trial basis depending
on the ease of naming the most recent stimulus.
For example, following an easy item, the criterion might
be adjusted to a more strict position, resulting in a faster
response on the next trial. A second way is that there may
be changes in how participants perceive the passage of
time, with stimulus difficulty on one trial affecting time
perception on the next trial. For example, perceived time
may pass more quickly after an easy item is responded to.
Thus, the criterion would be reached sooner on the next
trial, producing a faster response.
Recently, Taylor and Lupker (2006) provided evidence
supporting the idea that time perception processes
can play a role in speeded response tasks. In Taylor and
Lupker’s (2006) experiments, participants were asked to
name stimuli but to delay their naming responses until
the presented stimulus had been on the computer screen
for exactly 1 sec. The standard stimulus difficulty effects
seen in speeded naming (i.e., frequency, lexicality) also
appeared in this internal-timing task.
Taylor and Lupker’s (2006) explanation for these results
is based on the idea that if participants are using a time criterion,
they must monitor the passage of time in order to
Sequential effects in time perception
TAMSEN E. TAYLOR AND STEPHEN J. LUPKER
University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada
Taylor and Lupker (2001) reported that in a naming task, stimuli were named more rapidly when preceded by
an easy-to-name stimulus than when preceded by a difficult-to-name stimulus (sequential effects). The goal of
the present research was to investigate whether sequential effects could be explained in terms of time perception
processes (within the context of Lupker, Brown, and Colombo’s [1997] time criterion account). Participants were
required to name easy and difficult stimuli (high-frequency words and nonwords in Experiment 1; words only
in Experiment 2). Each naming trial was followed by a set of asterisks (*****). The participants were required
to press a button when they thought the asterisks had been presented for exactly 1 sec. Time intervals produced
after naming difficult stimuli were longer than time intervals produced after naming easy stimuli. That is, time
perception was affected by the difficulty of word/nonword naming in a way that carried over to the next stimulus,
supporting the idea that carryover effects in time perception may be the source of sequential effects in the
naming task.
SEQUENTIAL EFFECTS IN TIME PERCEPTION 71
know when the criterion has been reached. Hence, any impact
of stimulus difficulty on time perception should show
up in any task in which responding is based on timing operations
(i.e., according to the time criterion account, in all
speeded response tasks). In fact, the time perception literature
contains considerable evidence that people’s time
perception processes are affected by the difficulty of the
stimuli being processed and that the direction of these effects
is consistent with Taylor and Lupker’s (2006) recent
results. For example, Warm and McCray (1969) presented
words that varied in frequency and length for exactly
1 sec. The participants were asked to estimate the duration
of the stimuli. Warm and McCray observed significant
effects of word frequency and length on duration estimations,
with participants perceiving easier words (highfrequency
and short words) as being presented for a longer
time than were more difficult words (low-frequency and
long words), even though all the words were presented for
1 sec. Thus, time appears to pass more quickly when easy
stimuli are processed. Similar results have been reported
by Chastain and Ferraro (1997) and Hochhaus, Swanson,
and Carter (1991), also using words as stimuli, as well as
by a number of researchers using other tasks and stimuli
(e.g., Brown, 1985; Brown, Stubbs, & West, 1992; Casini
& Macar, 1997; Fortin, Rousseau, Bourque, & Kirouac,
1993; Hicks, Miller, & Kinsbourne, 1976; McClain, 1983;
Thomas & Weaver, 1975).
If stimulus difficulty does influence time perception in
the way indicated by these findings and if a time criterion
does control responding in speeded tasks, the implication
is that time perception processes are likely playing some
role in those tasks. The present research was an attempt to
determine whether time perception processes might also
play a role in producing the sequential effects observed
by Taylor and Lupker (2001) or whether the sequential
effects have a different cause, such as trial-by-trial adjustments
of the time criterion.
EXPERIMENT 1
In both experiments, the participants were required to
perform two alternating tasks. First, they named a presented
stimulus. After an intertrial interval, they attempted
to produce a 1-sec interval (by pressing a button) in response
to a string of asterisks. The timing stimulus (the
string of asterisks) was identical on all the trials. Therefore,
any difference in the produced timing intervals would
presumably have to be due to carryover effects from the
preceding (naming) trial. If the sequential effects observed
by Taylor and Lupker (2001) were due to changes in time
perception, carryover effects in time perception should be
observed. The participants in Experiment 1 should produce
shorter time intervals after naming an easy stimulus
(a high-frequency word) than after naming a difficult
stimulus (a nonword) (i.e., time would seem to pass more
rapidly after an easy stimulus had been named). In contrast,
if sequential effects are due to changing the position
of the time criterion for naming on a trial-by-trial basis,
no carryover effects onto timing trials would be expected,
because the participants should be using different criteria
for the two types of trials. That is, they would be using a
criterion designed to time a 1-sec interval on timing trials
and a criterion that maximizes speeded-naming performance
on naming trials.
Method
Participants. Fifty-three undergraduate students received course
credit in an introductory psychology course for their participation
in this experiment. The participants reported having normal or
corrected-to-normal vision and being native speakers of English.
Apparatus. The stimuli were presented on an IBM clone computer
system (Trillium Computer Resources Model 316S-80MS),
with a TTX Multiscan Monitor (Model 3435P). Both a microphone
and a button box were used to record responses. The experimenter
was present to record naming errors.
Stimuli. The easy stimuli were 30 high-frequency words.
 The difficult stimuli were 30 pronounceable nonwords
(stimuli available at psychonomic.org/archive; see archived materials
for Taylor & Lupker, 2006). The stimuli were presented in a different
random order for each participant. The participants received
six practice trials, and these practice trials were always presented in
the same order.
Procedure. The participants were tested individually. They were
told that two types of trials would be presented in a strictly alternating
fashion. First, they would be presented with a letter string, which
they were to read aloud as quickly and as accurately as possible.
Following each naming trial, a row of asterisks (*****) would appear
on the computer screen. They should press a key on the button
box when they thought that the asterisks had been on the screen for
exactly 1 sec.
An attempt was made to constrain timing responses to a reasonable
approximation of 1 sec by presenting a high-pitched warning tone
when responses were faster than 500 msec and presenting a lower
pitched warning tone when responses were slower than 1,500 msec.
The participants were instructed to use the tones as feedback and to
adjust their timing performance appropriately. Next, the six practice
trials were presented. The experimental trials followed.
Initially, a fixation cross appeared in the middle of the screen,
remaining until the experiment was complete. The stimuli were presented
centered above the cross and remained until the letter string
was named or the button box registered a timing response. Naming
and timing trials strictly alternated. There was a 2-sec interval between
the participant's response and an auditory cue indicating that
the next trial was about to begin. The stimulus was presented 1 sec
after the cue (for a total intertrial interval of 3,000 msec). An auditory
cue was employed because it had also been used in the sequential
effects experiments reported in Taylor and Lupker (2001).
Results
Data trimming. Trials on which naming responses
were incorrect were eliminated from the latency analyses
(2.6% of the word trials and 8.2% of the nonword trials). A
trial was considered an outlier and omitted from the latency
analyses if the naming latency was less than 150 msec or
greater than 1,500 msec (no trials had latencies that were
less than 150 msec; 0.1% of the high-frequency word trials
and 0.9% of the nonword trials had latencies that were
greater than 1,500 msec). Timing trials were considered
outliers if latencies were less than 500 msec (6.5% of
the trials for both words and nonwords) or greater than
1,500 msec (0.4% of the trials for words and 1.3% of the
trials for nonwords). Timing outliers were replaced with
the cutoff latency (i.e., 500 or 1,500 msec).
72 TAYLOR AND LUPKER
Comparison. We used t tests to compare naming latencies
for high-frequency words and nonwords, as well
as timing latencies produced after each type of naming
trial. The means are presented in Table 1. Naming latencies
for high-frequency words were shorter than naming
latencies for nonwords [tS(52) ? 8.53, p ? .001; tI(58) ?
9.39, p ? .001]. The difference between timing latencies
following high-frequency words versus nonwords was
also significant [tS(52) ? 2.94, p ? .01; tI(58) ? 3.16,
p ? .01]. The correlation between mean naming latency
and mean timing latency for all the items was also significant
[r(60) ? ?.58; t(58) ? 5.42, p ? .001, one-tailed],
as was the correlation for nonwords alone [r(30) ? ?.64;
t(28) ? 4.41, p ? .001, one-tailed], but not for words alone
[r(30) ? ?.06; t(28) ? 0.32, n.s.].
Discussion
As expected, naming latencies for high-frequency
words were significantly shorter than naming latencies
for nonwords. More importantly, this difference carried
over, as indicated by the significantly shorter timing durations
following words than following nonwords and the
significant positive correlation between naming latencies
and subsequent timing latencies. This timing difference
occurring after easy versus difficult stimuli supports the
idea that the difficulty of naming an item influences time
perception and that whatever changes in time perception
arise during a naming trial last at least 3 sec. Thus, these
results suggest that a time perception account of sequential
effects is to be preferred to an account based on trialby-
trial alterations in the position of the time criterion.
Although the results of Experiment 1 provide evidence
that time perception is influenced by the difficulty of the
stimulus being named and that the effect lasts at least 3 sec,
one could argue that this effect may have been an artifact
of using nonwords as the difficult stimuli. For example,
the participants may have continued to think about whether
their nonword pronunciation was correct, distracting them
from the timing task. Indeed, the correlation between
naming and timing latencies for words alone was not significant,
although this was probably due to the severe restriction
of range on naming latencies for high-frequency
words. Experiment 2 involved an identical task alternation
manipulation; however, only words (of varying difficulty)
were used, in order to examine this possible alternative
explanation. Because sequential effects in naming are
typically small (8–17 msec), it was necessary to produce
a large range of word-naming times. As such, the selected
words varied dramatically on both frequency and length.
EXPERIMENT 2
Method
Participants. Forty-seven undergraduate students received course
credit in an introductory psychology course for their participation in
this experiment. The participants reported having normal or correctedto-
normal vision and being native speakers of English. Seven of these
participants were not included in the analysis because their combined
mechanical and naming error rate was greater than 30%.
Stimuli, Apparatus, and Procedure. The stimuli consisted
of 84 words, ranging from 3 to 14 letters in length and from 0 to
451,298 in frequency (HAL norms from elexicon database; stimuli available at psychonomic.org/archive; see archived
materials for Taylor & Lupker, 2006). Items were selected so
that a wide range of naming times would be produced. To aid this
process, the elexicon.wustl.edu Web site  was
consulted. All other aspects of the procedure and apparatus were the
same as those in Experiment 1.
Results
Data trimming. Trials in which the naming response
was incorrect were eliminated from the latency analyses
(10.0% of the trials). A trial was considered an outlier
and omitted from the latency analyses if the naming latency
was less than 150 msec or greater than 2,000 msec
(no trials had latencies less than 150 msec; on 2.6% of
the trials, latencies were greater than 2,000 msec). Timing
trials were considered outliers if latencies were less than
500 msec (2.1% of the trials) or greater than 1,500 msec
(2.7% of the trials). Timing outliers were replaced with the
cutoff latency (i.e., 500 or 1,500 msec).
In addition, error rates for individual items were examined,
and any item for which more than 30% of the
trials were errors (including microphone and pronunciation
errors) were removed from the analysis. Eleven items
were removed (contaminate, electrocution, premeditation,
indoctrination, preservative, extenuating, resuscitate,
wherewithal, companionable, senility, and intransitive).
Comparison. A correlation was perfvormed to determine
whether naming latency was related to the duration
of the produced interval. The correlation between mean
naming latency and mean timing latency was significant
[r(73) ? ?.27; t(71) ? 2.36, p ? .05, one-tailed].
Discussion
Consistent with the results of Experiment 1, word naming
latencies in Experiment 2 were significantly related
to timing durations. This relationship between naming
latency and timing duration supports the idea that the difficulty
of naming an item influences time perception and
that whatever changes in time perception arise during a

SEQUENTIAL EFFECTS IN TIME PERCEPTION 73
naming trial last at least 3 sec. As in Experiment 1, these
results support a time perception account of Taylor and
Lupker’s (2001) sequential effects, while providing no
support for their alternative explanation of sequential effects,
that there are trial-by-trial alterations in the position
of the time criterion.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
The results of the present experiments support the idea
that the sequential effects observed by Taylor and Lupker
(2001) were time perception effects. In fact, the size of
the timing sequential effect observed in Experiment 1 is
virtually identical to the size of the naming sequential effects
in Taylor and Lupker’s (2001) experiments.
The obvious next question is, what is the mechanism
underlying these influences on time perception? The predominant
explanation of stimulus difficulty effects on
time perception is that they are due to attentional resource
demands. In general, cognitive models of time perception
include an internal clock (the exact location and nature of
which are usually unspecified) that produces “ticks” at
regular enough intervals that they can be used to monitor
the passage of time reasonably accurately, a “counter” that
registers these ticks, and some sort of memory mechanism
to keep track of how many ticks occurred during a specified
interval (as a standard for comparison). It is assumed
that there is a strong positive correlation between the number
of ticks counted and perceived duration (i.e., the more
ticks counted, the longer the interval is perceived to be). It
is also assumed that attention is required in order to accurately
count ticks. When attention is allocated elsewhere
(e.g., to word reading), the tendency is to miss ticks, and
therefore, the elapsed time is underestimated. Thus, Warm
and McCray (1969) explained their results by arguing that
because longer/low-frequency words are harder to process
than shorter/high-frequency words, participants could not
devote as much attention to monitoring the passage of
time when processing longer/low-frequency words. As a
result, time appeared to pass more slowly when longer/
low-frequency words were processed.
The attention allocation account provides a perfectly adequate
explanation for online effects of stimulus difficulty
on time perception—that is, those effects that occur during
that period of time in which both stimulus processing
and timing operations are taking place. However, the attention
allocation account does not predict carryover effects
in time perception such as those observed here, because
once stimulus processing is complete (e.g., after the word
or nonword has been named), the allocation of attention
will be controlled only by the processing of the subsequent
stimulus (i.e., the asterisks; see Fortin et al., 1993).
Assuming the same general structures (i.e., an internal
clock, a counter, and a memory mechanism), a second way
in which processing difficulty could affect time perception
would be through a change in the tick rate of the internal
clock. Factors such as physiological arousal have been
proposed to influence internal clock speed through such
a mechanism (e.g., Block, 1990). To account for Warm
and McCray’s (1969) results, the argument would be that
the more difficult processing was, the slower the tick rate
would be. Again, as a result, time would appear to pass more
slowly while more difficult stimuli were processed (i.e.,
fewer ticks would occur during the processing interval).
In contrast to the attention allocation account, the clock
speed account might be able to explain sequential effects
if it were the case that changes in tick rate carry over from
one trial to another. As has been noted, changes in tick rate
are typically proposed to be due to changes in physiological
arousal. Researchers have attempted to manipulate physiological
arousal (and thereby manipulate clock speed) in
many ways, including presenting beeps before a stimulus
to increase arousal (e.g., Wearden, Philpott, & Win, 1999),
increasing arousal by inducing stress (e.g., Ozel, Larue,
& Dosseville, 2004), and increasing emotional arousal
(e.g., Droit-Volet, Brunot, & Niedenthal, 2004). In all of
these cases, changes in physiological arousal do appear to
be relatively long-lasting. Thus, these changes in arousal
could certainly last through a typical interstimulus interval,
potentially explaining the trial-by-trial sequential effects
observed by Taylor and Lupker (2001).
Note, however, that the typical effect of physiological
arousal is in the opposite direction to that which would
be expected from the nature of the sequential effects observed
by Taylor and Lupker (2001). That is, in Taylor and
Lupker’s (2001) experiments, participants responded more
slowly to an item preceded by a difficult item. This result
could be explained only as an effect of physiological
arousal if it could be assumed that difficult items cause the
internal clock to slow down. Logically, however, difficult
stimuli would seem to be more arousing than easy stimuli.
Thus, if anything, difficult stimuli should increase physiological
arousal and clock speed, rather than decreasing it.
At present, then, it does not appear that either an attention
allocation account or a clock speed account, as currently
conceived, could provide an explanation of Taylor
and Lupker’s (2001) results. Although it is possible that either
account could be modified to explain those results, the
clock speed account would seem to have slightly more potential.
Two issues would need to be addressed. First, there
must be a mechanism that allows the speed of the clock to
shift somewhat rapidly. Second, and more importantly, this
shifting mechanism must work in the way required by the
data. That is, the mechanism must slow down the clock as
a result of difficult processing, rather than speed it up.
The situation is even less promising for attention allocation
accounts. To explain carryover effects in time
perception, an attention allocation account must provide
some means by which stimulus difficulty effects on time
perception remain after processing is complete. Although
current attention allocation accounts do not appear to
allow for this possibility (e.g., Fortin et al., 1993), there
are results from a number of other paradigms suggesting
that longer lasting changes in attention allocation do occur.
For example, Tipper, Grison, and Kessler (2003) showed
evidence that attention was less likely to be allocated to a
previously seen stimulus that was ignored (inhibition of
return), an effect which lasted for at least 3 min. Thus, it is
74 TAYLOR AND LUPKER
not impossible that there would be a mechanism that could
produce long-term effects on attention allocation, leading
to carryover effects in time perception.
The present data, coupled with Taylor and Lupker’s
(2006) results, provide strong evidence that time perception
processes play an important role in speeded-response
tasks. However, one should note that sequential effects,
the focus of the present investigation, are relatively small
effects. Furthermore, in a stimulus block containing varied
stimuli, stimulus randomization would mean that sequential
effects probably will not affect the various stimulus
conditions differentially. Thus, in a practical sense, the
impact of these effects on the means of the various conditions
in a mixed block will be quite small. In contrast, the
impact of sequential effects on latencies in pure blocks
of easy and hard stimuli may be more noticeable, due to
the fact that each stimulus in a pure block of easy stimuli
will benefit from having an easy stimulus preceding it
(and vice versa). Nonetheless, from the perspective of the
time criterion account, what is probably more important in
terms of affecting mean latencies are the changes in criterion
position, from trial block to trial block, as a function
of the difficulty of the stimuli in that block.
In summary, the present results demonstrate that the difficulty
of stimulus processing affects time perception after
the stimulus has disappeared. This fact, together with the
principles outlined in Lupker et al.’s (1997) time criterion
account, is consistent with the notion that the sequential
effects in naming reported by Taylor and Lupker (2001) are
the result of carryover effects of stimulus difficulty on time
perception and are not due to trial-by-trial shifts in the position
of the time criterion. In addition, because the currently
held ideas about how time perception is affected by stimulus
difficulty—the attention allocation and clock speed accounts—
cannot explain carryover effects in time perception,
the present research also suggests that researchers
should consider ways to expand time perception theories.
